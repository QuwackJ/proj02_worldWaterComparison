This is a project I did in college to learn about ArrayList, wrapper classes, binary search, and pass-through methods.

The goal of the project is to create a SortedArrayList (a wrapper class of ArrayList) of YearlyWaterRecord data read from the IsoYearWaterData.txt file. Additionally, the data from the CountriesAndIsoCodes.txt file is stored in parallel arrays.

The main method instantiates a WaterComparisonGui object that allows the user to compare two year/country pairs with their water results side by side.
